# Report Widget for ArcGIS Web AppBuilder

The report widget enables the user to configure the widget to create several maps and reports for a selected feature or user drawn graphic. The report widget includes the Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS widget and a python script to be published as a geoprocessing service to ArcGIS Server. This report widget can be added to a Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS (Developer Edition) application or can be added as an item to an enterprise portal site and used within ArcGIS Enterprise.
